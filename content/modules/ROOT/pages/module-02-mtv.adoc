= Migrating Existing Virtual Machines

== Introduction

This portion of our lab uses the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/[Migration Toolkit for Virtualization^] (MTV) to import virtual machines from VMware vSphere to OpenShift. The migration toolkit supports two "modes" of import:

* Cold migration turns off the source virtual machine before starting the migration. This is the default migration type.
* Warm migration copies data while the source virtual machine continues to run. Once the bulk of data has been migrated, the VM is shutdown and the final data is copied to the destination. The new VM can then be started, resulting in a much shorter period of downtime for the VM-hosted application.

NOTE: The migration toolkit has already been deployed to your cluster using the Operator available in OperatorHub.

Documentation for how to install and configure the Operator can be found https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.6/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/installing-the-operator_mtv[here^].

If you would like to learn more about how to configure the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization for your own needs, please see the documentation at the following links for:

.*Goals*

* Explore the VMware vSphere environment
* Review the configuration for the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV)
* Create a Migration Plan
* Migrate VMs into OpenShift Virtualization

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites for Migrations

The following prerequisites apply to all migrations:

* ISO/CD-ROM disks must be unmounted.
* Each NIC must contain one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address.
* The VM operating system must be certified and supported for use as a guest operating system for https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163#ocpvirt[OpenShift Virtualization^].
* VM names must contain only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), or hyphens (-), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (.), or special characters.
* VM names must not duplicate the name of an existing VM in the OpenShift Virtualization environment.

NOTE: The *Migration Toolkit for Virtualization* will automatically assign a new name to a VM that does not comply with the rules, doing so allows the migration to proceed without issue.

== Migrating Virtual Machines from VMware

A three-tier application has been deployed on VMware for you to migrate to OpenShift.

The application consists of the following four virtual machines:

* One HAproxy system that redirects traffic to the web servers.
* One Linux system running a MariaDB database.
* Two Microsoft Windows servers with IIS hosting a PHP application connecting to the database.

For this lab, you will be tasked with migrating three of the four virtual machines using cold migration.

NOTE: You will not need to migrate the HAproxy (load balancer) VM because OpenShift handles network traffic and load balancing natively for VMs connected to the SDN using a *Service*.

=== Review the VMware environment

To help understand the process of mapping resources, such as datastores and port groups, from vSphere into OpenShift's equivalents, storage classes and network attachment definitions, let's begin by reviewing the source environment for the migrations.

. Navigate to VMware vCenter: https://{vcenter_console}[vCenter Console^]
. Click on *Launch vSphere Client*
. Login with the following credentials:
- *User:* {vcenter_full_user}
- *Password:* {vcenter_password}

. By default you'll land in the *Inventory* view at the top of the navigation tree with a message that you have no privileges to view this object. This is expected with the current user account.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/00_VMware_First_Login.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click the *Workloads* icon and expand the navigation tree until you see the folder named *Roadshow*, and the 4 VMs under it.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/01_Workload_VM_List.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click on the *VMs* icon at the top of the screen to see the details of each virtual machine in the folder.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/02_VM_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Change to the *Networks* view, then expand the tree to view the port group used by the virtual machines. Note that the name is *segment-migrating-to-ocpvirt*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/03_vSphere_Network.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Finally, review the datastores in use by browsing to the *Datastores* view. Expand the tree to see the datastores that are attached to the *RS00* datacenter, and optionally browse to the *VMs* sub-tab to view the capacity used by each virtual machine.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/04_vSphere_Datastore.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

=== Review the VMware provider to the migration toolkit

Now that we have completed our review of VMware vSphere and the virtual machines that reside there, you may close the window and return to your OpenShift web console.

NOTE: The *Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV)* is officially a separate tool from OpenShift Virtualization, and cannot be accessed from the *Virtualization* persona.

. In the left-side menu, click on *Virtualization* and from the dropdown select *Administrator*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/05_Admin_Persona.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *Providers for virtualization*

. Select project *mtv-{user}* at the top of the page.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/06_MTV_Providers.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: MTV 2.4 and later are project/namespace aware and do not require administrator privileges. You can delegate VM imports to application teams and VM users so that they can self-serve and migrate at their own pace!

By default, there is a provider called *host* which represents *OpenShift Virtualization* as a target platform.

Additionally, this lab has already been configured with an additional provider named *vmware* which you can see has an endpoint address of the VMware vSphere cluster we were just exploring.

=== Create a Target Namespace for Your Migration

You'll need a namespace to house your migrated virtual machines.

In OpenShift, namespaces are enhanced in a custom resource called projects.
Creating a project creates a namespace.

. In the left-side menu, click on *Home->Projects* and on the upper right, click *Create Project*

. In the *Create Project* dialog, enter the following:

- *Name:* vmexamples-{user}

. Click *Create*.

=== Create a Migration Plan

Now that we have reviewed our environment, and have our providers created, it is time for us to create a *Migration Plan*. This plan selects which VMs to migrate from VMware vSphere to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization and specifics about how to execute the migration.

IMPORTANT: Switch to the mtv-{user} project to complete the steps in this section.

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *Plans for virtualization* and press *Create Plan*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/07_Create_VMWARE_Plan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. You will be asked to select the source provider that you intend to migrate from. Click on the *VMware* tile.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/08_VMware_Source_Provider.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. A large number of virtual machines in the environment will be displayed, use the provided search bar and search for your user account: *{user}* to search for the VMs you'd like to select.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/09_VM_Search.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. On the next page select the three VMs you would like to move:

* database-{user}
* winweb01-{user}
* winweb02-{user}

. Click *Next*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/10_VM_Select_VMWARE_Plan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. On the next screen you will be tasked with providing details for your migration plan. Several details will already be filled in for you, but you will have to make a few minor modifications to ensure that the VMs land in the correct namespace, and that the networks and storage options map correctly.
+
Please fill in your migration plan with the following values:

* *Plan name*: move-webapp-vmware
* *Target provider*: host
* *Target namespace*: vmexamples-{user}
* *Network map*: Pod Networking
* *Storage map*: ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
+
NOTE: Both the Network and Storage maps will automatically detect the Networks and Datastores that the discovered virtual machines currently make use of on the source provider. You will just need to make sure that their respective values are set correctly on the OpenShift side.

. Click the *Create migration plan* button.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/11_Create_Migration_Plan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. You will be taken to a new screen where you will see that the plan for migration is being made ready.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/12_Migration_Plan_Unready.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. After a few moments the plan will become *Ready*, click on the blue "Start Migration" button to start the migration process.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/13_Migration_Plan_Ready.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. You will be presented with a confirmation box to begin the migration, click on the *Start* button.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/14_Confirm_Migrate_Start.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. A progress bar will appear in the center of the screen along with the status of *0 of 3 VMs migrated*.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/15_VMs_Migrating.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Click on the *0 of 3 VMs migrated* link and you will be presented with a page with more details about the migration process.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/16_VMs_Migrating_Details.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. You can click the drop-down arrow next to the name of each VM being migrated to get additional details about the stages of the migration process.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/17_VM_Migration_Stages.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+

IMPORTANT: It is suggested to have a 10gbps network for virtual machine migrations which we do not have in our simulated lab environment. This, combined with having many participants performing the same task in parallel can cause this task to perform much slower than in a real environment. Please be patient with this process as it completes. You may continue with other sections in the roadshow as the migrations complete in the background. We will return to work with these machines in a later module.

. After several minutes we will see that the migration has completed successfully.
+
image::2025_spring/module-02-mtv/18_Completed_VMWARE_Plan.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. The selected VMs have now been migrated and can be started on OpenShift Virtualization at your leisure.

== Summary

In this section we explored the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization, and used it to assist with the migration of existing virtual machines from a VMware vSphere environment to OpenShift Virtualization. In addition to the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization, there are two other migration toolkits currently available. The combination of these can be used to move many types of workloads into and within OpenShift clusters depending on your organization's needs.
