=== Virtualization Migration Assessment

* A two-week onsite interactive workshop and follow-up report.
* Experienced Red Hat architects run a short series of onsite workshops to help develop your migration journey.
* They provide an extensive review of your virtualization environment and it's current integrations including: networking, storage, security, backup, and disaster recovery.
* You recieve a VMA report with a tailored proposal for your complete migration incluing high-level recommendations and design considerations.
* This can help with understanding of where you're going, how you'll get there, how long it will take, and how much it will cost.
