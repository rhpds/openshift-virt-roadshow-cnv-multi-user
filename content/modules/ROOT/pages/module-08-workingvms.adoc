=  Working with Virtual Machines and Applications

== Introduction

This section of our lab is dedicated to the Day-2 operations that many administrators would need to perform when working with virtual machines in their OpenShift Virtualization environment. We will make use of the understanding we have developed throughout this roadshow of how VMs operate in an OpenShift environment, and use those skills to complete the tasks in this section. In this particular case, we are going to work with the three virtual machines that we imported from VMware vSphere earlier in this roadshow, and we are going to make some minor configuration changes to enable the applications hosted on those servers to be accessed as they now run in OpenShift Virtualization. To accomplish this, we will expose our applications using the service/route method that is the default when making use of the OpenShift SDN pod network so that the application is reachable from outside of the cluster.

[[service_route]]
== Exposing an Application with a Service/Route

By default, virtual machines are connected to the SDN, which is a convenient and easy way to give them access to the rest of the network, but can be challenging for the virtual machines, and other pods in the OpenShift cluster, to find and connect to the virtualized applications. To solve this, we will use a *Service* to balance connections across the two Windows-based web servers, and create a DNS entry for each service discovery, then create a *Route* to allow external clients to access the application hosted within the virtual machines.

IMPORTANT: If you have not completed the module *Migrating Existing Virtual Machines*, it is recommended that you do that module first. If you have not completed it, or the migration process is still pending, you can use pre-existing virtual machines that have been prepared for you, which are available in the *vmimported* project. If you are using these pre-imported virtual machines, please replace all instances of the *vmexamples* namespace with *vmimported* in the examples below.  You will also need to shorten the names of the virtual machines to match what's in the *vmimported* namespace.

=== Introduction to Services

The *Service* identifies the source/target for traffic, and directs clients to, the endpoints based on labels. Currently, the VMs do not have a label assigned yet.

In order to successfully associate the  VMs with the Service, we need to do the following:

* Add a label to the VMs. We will use the same label for both Windows IIS servers because they are both behind the same load balancer.
* Create the service to make the two Windows IIS servers available for other workloads on the cluster. OpenShift will automatically make the load balancer internally accessible using the name of the Service as the DNS name.
* Make the service available outside of OpenShift by creating a *Route*.

To begin, we'll add labels to the virtual machines by modifying their definition in the OpenShift Virtualization GUI.

=== Label the virtual machines

. From the OpenShift console, navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* and ensure the migrated VMs successfully imported and are running.

+
NOTE: Ensure you select the correct project, *vmexamples-{user}* if you completed the *Migrating Existing Virtual Machines* module or *vmimported-{user}* if you did not.

. Select to the *winweb01-{guid}-{user}* VM and navigate to the *YAML* tab.
. Find the *spec:* section and under the *template.metadata* add the following lines to *labels* section in the VM resources:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
env: webapp
----
+
IMPORTANT: Make sure to get the indentation exactly right - just like in the screenshot below.
+
image::module-08-workingvms/12_Imported_VMs_YAML.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. *Repeat* the process for the VM *winweb02*.
. Start the *database-{guid}-{user}* virtual machine if it's not already running.
. Start, or restart if already running, the *winweb01-{guid}-{user}* and *winweb02-{guid}-{user}* virtual machines.
+
NOTE: Ensure the VMs are properly working by accessing to the console tab of each VM.

=== Create the Service

. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Services* and press *Create Service*.
+
image::module-08-workingvms/13_Navigate_Service.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Replace the YAML with the following definition
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp
  namespace: vmexamples-{user}
spec:
  selector:
    env: webapp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
----
+
IMPORTANT: Ensure the *namespace* with your virtual machines, *vmexamples-{user}* or *vmimported-{user}*, is the one used in the Service YAML.
+
image::module-08-workingvms/14_Service_YAML.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Press *Create*.
. From the details page for the newly created *webapp* Service, locate *Pod selector* link and click it.
+
image::module-08-workingvms/15_Imported_VMs_PodSelector.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Verify the two Windows VMs are properly identified and targeted by the Service.
+

=== Create the Route

Now the Windows IIS servers are accessible from within the OpenShift cluster. Other virtual machines are able to access them using the DNS name *webapp.vmexamples*, which is determined by the name of the Service + the namespace. However, since these web servers are the front end to an application we want to be externally accessible, we will expose it using a *Route*.

. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes* in the left navigation menu, verify that you're using the correct project name. Press *Create Route*.
+
image::module-08-workingvms/17_Route_Navigation.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Fill the form using the information below, press *Create* when done.
+
.. *Name*: *route-webapp*
.. *Service*: *webapp*
.. *Target port*: *80 -> 80 (TCP)*
.. *Secure Route*: *Enabled*
.. *TLS termination*: *Edge*
.. *Insecure traffic*: *Redirect*
+
image::module-08-workingvms/18_Create_Route.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. Navigate to the address shown in *Location* field
+
image::module-08-workingvms/19_Route_Access.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. When the page loads, you will see an error. This is because the Windows web servers are not able to currently connect to the database VM after it's migration.
+
image::module-08-workingvms/20_WebApp_Error.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
NOTE: To fix the connectivity issue, we need to create a Service for the database VM so that it can be accessed by the web servers.

. Once again, navigate to *Networking* -> *Services* and press *Create Service*. Replace the YAML with the following definition:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: database
  namespace: vmexamples-{user}
spec:
  selector:
    vm.kubevirt.io/name: database-{guid}-{user}
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 3306
    targetPort: 3306
----
+
NOTE: This time we used the name of the virtual machine to attach it to the service we are creating, since there is only one VM named *database-{guid}-{user}* in the namespace with this name it is safe to do so without having to customize the YAML of the VM or rebooting the guest.
+
CAUTION: If you are using the *vmimported-{user}* project, make sure you select the correct `selector` value: `vm.kubevirt.io/name: database`.
+
image::module-08-workingvms/21_Database_YAML.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

. When the YAML is pasted, click the *Create* button.
+
IMPORTANT: Ensure the namespace with your virtual machines, *vmexamples-{user}* or *vmimported-{user}* is the one used in the Service YAML.
+
. Reload the webapp URL and expect to get the proper result

== Summary

In this module you were able to experience working with the virtual machines that you migrated into the OpenShift Virtualization environment from VMware vSphere by making them accessible outside of the cluster in different manners.

I hope you have enjoyed the OpenShift Virtualization Roadshow and this lab that accompanied it. Please fill out the survey link that your proctor has made available to provide feedback on your experience.
