= Welcome to {lab_name}!

[%hardbreaks]
== Introduction

Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization, an included feature of Red Hat OpenShift, enables you to migrate, run and deploy virtual machines (VMs) onto a modern application platform.
OpenShift Virtualization provides a seamless environment where VMs can coexist alongside containerized workloads, using a consistent set of management tools and processes.
This flexibility allows users to maintain existing virtualization investments while embracing modern management principles.

As an included feature of Red Hat OpenShift, the migration toolkit for virtualization (MTV) provides a suite of tools to migrate VMs quickly and at scale.
This lab is designed to demonstrate how users can leverage the toolkit to seamlessly migrate their VMs from a VMware environment to Red Hat OpenShift.

== Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

* *OpenShift Virtualization* is a feature of Red Hat OpenShift and allows users to deploy, manage, and connect virtual machines to an OpenShift cluster using Kubernetes-native methods.
* *OpenShift Virtualization is based on the "container-native virtualization"* technology being developed upstream under the KubeVirt project, a sandbox project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
* It *leverages the Red Hat Enterprise Linux KVM hypervisor (RHEL KVM)*, which is a mature and highly performant open-source hypervisor used by many organizations and cloud service providers globally and which has been under development for over 15 years.
* OpenShift Virtualization is *SVVP certified with Microsoft for Windows guest support* per the same rules that apply to Red Hatâ€™s other KVM virtualization offerings.
* OpenShift Virtualization is currently *only supported on bare metal physical servers*, typically on-premises or through dedicated hosting.
Support for other topologies (OpenShift deployed on virtualized infrastructure like RHV or vSphere) is not available at this time.
* Support for *#AWS# / Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS has already been announced*, and we are in the process of adding support for OpenShift Virtualization to additional Managed OpenShift Cloud services.

== The Migration Toolkit for Virtualization

The migration toolkit for virtualization (MTV) is a *feature included with Red Hat OpenShift* that helps simplify the migration process of VMs from other hypervisors onto OpenShift Virtualization.

You can use the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) to migrate virtual machines from the following source providers to OpenShift Virtualization destination providers:

* VMware vSphere
* Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)
* OpenStack
* Open Virtual Appliances (OVAs) that were created by VMware vSphere
* Remote OpenShift Virtualization clusters

== Content Covered in the Lab

These are the three main sections that will be covered:

* *Cold Migrations of Existing Virtual Machines*: In this section, we will use MTV to perform a cold migration of a VM from an existing VMware vSphere environment to OpenShift Virtualization.
* *Warm Migrations and Automated Actions*: In this section, we will provide a description of how a warm migration will be achieved through MTV along with an interactive demo of the process.
We will also look into how migration hooks can be used to automate a change in behaviors for virtual guests during migration.
* *Working with Virtual Machines and Applications*: In this section, we will perform several Day-2 activities with our imported virtual machines, including setting up a load-balancer, and exposing our VM hosted applications through services and routes.


== Requirements for the Lab Environment
